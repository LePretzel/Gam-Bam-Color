A simple Gameboy Color emulator I work on on-and-off, I started building mainly as a fun project to learn Rust with, but I enjoyed making it so I come back every once in a while. Currently the cpu, memory, and timer compoenents are working well, but there are still a lot of problems with the ppu and input, so there are a lot of graphical glitches and games aren't exactly playable right now. I plan on fixing it at some point, but that will involve digging through a lot of Gameboy hardware documentation, so it might have to wait a little bit.
