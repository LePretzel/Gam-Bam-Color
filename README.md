A simple Gameboy Color emulator I work on on-and-off, I started building mainly as a fun project to learn Rust with, but I enjoyed making it so I come back every once in a while. Currently the cpu, memory, and timer compoenents are working well, but there are still a lot of problems with the ppu and input, so there are a lot of graphical glitches and games aren't exactly playable right now.
